      I am software engineer at JustTrack working primarily with asynchronous event driven microservices. I am interseted in large scale distributed systems and I love to learn about the design and trade-off that goes into building such systems. 
      I am trying to learn more about systems and network programming. My aim is to write clean, modular and robust code to solve interesting business and tech problems.
      Outside of work I enjoy football, working out and traveling.
