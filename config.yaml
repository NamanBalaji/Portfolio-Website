      I am software engineer at JustTrack working primarily with backend systems. I recnetly graduated from Manipal University with a bachelor's in Computer Science. 
      I am interseted in large scale distributed systems and the design and trade-off that goes into building such systems. While writing code my focus is on efficiency, modularity, mantainablity and robustness of the code.
      When I'm not coding I spend time playing/watching football, watching anime/movies or reading manga.
